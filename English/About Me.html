        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is César Romeo, and I am currently a student at Niederrhein University in Krefeld, Germany, where I
            am taking the orientation semester with the goal of starting a degree in Computer Engineering in October.
            <br><br>
            I was born in Zaragoza, Spain, the city where I lived for most of my life. My interest in computing began at
            the age of 15, driven by curiosity and the enthusiasm to create my own video games. At that time, I
            discovered the Roblox platform, where I took my first steps in programming using the Lua language. I
            developed my own clicker game with a simple interface and basic functionalities, which allowed me to
            familiarize myself with programming logic and interface development.
            <br><br>
            Later, I participated in a robotics course where, using LEGO pieces and sensors with motors, we designed an
            explorer robot. This project introduced me to the concepts of automation and programming applied in a
            physical environment, further strengthening my interest in technology.
            <br><br>
            During my school years, I also used tools such as Scratch and App Inventor, which allowed me to experiment
            with creating mobile applications and games, solidifying my self-learning abilities.
            <br><br>
            With the arrival of the pandemic, I moved to Germany, where I focused my efforts on learning the language
            and adapting to the environment. During this period, I worked in various sectors and took German classes in
            both academies and work environments. One of the most enriching experiences was volunteering at a youth
            center, where I was able to significantly improve my communication skills in German.
            <br><br>
            In recent months, I have rekindled my passion for computing and have decided to focus my professional career
            in this field. I am taking advantage of this orientation semester to reinforce my knowledge and prepare for
            the start of my degree, with the intention of combining my studies with a job opportunity that will allow me
            to gain practical experience in the sector.
